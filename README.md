👋 Hi, I'm Darshan
Master’s Student in Data Science | Passionate about AI & Data Engineering
I’m pursuing a master’s degree in Data Science in Berlin and enjoy solving real‑world problems with data. My experience ranges from building end‑to‑end machine‑learning pipelines and deploying models with Airflow and Docker to working with large language models (LLMs) and retrieval‑augmented generation systems. I’m business‑fluent in English and speak intermediate German, and I’m currently seeking AI‑focused internship opportunities.

🌱 Featured Projects
Project	Highlights	Technologies
Marketing ROI & Customer Value Analysis	This end‑to‑end case study dives into a marketing dataset to answer business questions such as which channels generate the most profit relative to ad spend, how valuable customers are over time and whether marketing spend is efficient

. Instead of stopping at exploration, the project adds simulated business context, computes KPIs (CLTV, ROI, CAC & Churn) and segments customers by channel, income and behaviour
github.com
. It demonstrates business‑focused analytics and data storytelling.	Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
Superstore Sales Analysis	Analyses Global Superstore retail data using SQL and Python
